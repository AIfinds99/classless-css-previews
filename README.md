Each framework is loaded via CDN from jsdelivr (initial page load will take a second ðŸ˜‰).

To make it on to this list, the framework must at least style a button element by default with no classes.

Thanks to [dbohdan/classless-css](https://github.com/dbohdan/classless-css) for the original list of frameworks.
